# Boostrap-Portofolio

In this project I implemented Boostrap 4.3. Most of the items are based on Boostrap, styling was altered in some areas to a custom one.
This is a follow up of my previous project for my portofolio page : https://codefastlearner.github.io/portofolio-project/ 

# Notes and Guide 

The page is intended to showcase that I am able to use Boostrap and manipulate it. Also it will provide with information about me and my professional background. 
The Projects section it's not functionable yet but soon projects will be added.
